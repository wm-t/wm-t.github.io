It remains an open question whether the range of uses associated with the English particle <i>just</i> can be analyzed uniformly. Much previous literature has focused on the exclusive uses of <i>just</i> with relatively little attention paid to its non-exclusive uses. We provide an analysis for the approximative use of <i>just</i>, which occurs with modified scalar predicates in sentences like <i>Mary is just taller than John</i> or <i>Mary is just as tall as John</i>. We argue that this use of <i>just</i> has two effects: (1) it conveys that its prejacent is true at a maximal level of precision, and (2) it conveys that its prejacent is not true at any lower level of precision that would make a stronger claim. On this analysis, the approximative use of <i>just</i> is similar to the exclusive use in that the effect in both cases is that stronger alternatives to the prejacent are ruled out.
