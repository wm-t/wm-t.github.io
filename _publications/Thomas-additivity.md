Many analyses of additive particles such as <i>too<i/>, <i>also<i/>, and <i>either<i/> have claimed that any such particle requires a contextually salient antecedent sentence that is a focus alternative of its prejacent or is a partial answer to the Question Under Discussion addressed by the prejacent. There is, however, a previously unstudied use---the argument-building use---which occurs without such an antecedent. This paper proposes an analysis of <i>too<i/> that accounts for the argument-building use and unifies it with the canonical additive use. The central claim is that <i>too<i/> is felicitous if and only if its antecedent can be taken to answer a relevant question such that the conjunction of <i>too<i/>â€™s antecedent and prejacent evidences some answer to that question more strongly than the antecedent does alone. This analysis relies on the notion of a "resolution" from Inquisitive Semantics and the treatment of context update as Bayesian inference, as is done in the Rational Speech Act framework. The treatment of <i>too<i/> developed here provides the basis for a new approach to additivity that can be extended to other additive expressions.
