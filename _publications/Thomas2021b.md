This paper proposes that the additive and disjunctive uses of English <i>either</i> share a semantic core. Formulated in Inquisitive Semantics, this core involves a requirement that <i>either</i> apply to an inquisitive proposition, which accounts for <i>either<i/>’s co-occurrence with disjunction. It also includes an additive presupposition that is more flexible than has previously been assumed in the literature, which allows the analysis to account for novel data in which additive <i>either</i> conveys that a proposition is unexpected or undesirable. The inability of <i>either</i> to appear in alternative questions is also pointed out and accounted for.
